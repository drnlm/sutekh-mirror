Sutekh 0.8.0 (2011-09-03)
-------------------------

On behalf of the Sutekh development team (of two) I'm delighted to
announce the release of Sutekh <version>.

<paragraph description new version>

Sutekh is available for Windows and Linux systems (with RPMs for
Fedora and a PPA for Ubuntu).

Instructions for installing Sutekh can be found at:

* https://sourceforge.net/p/sutekh/wiki/InstallInstructions/ 

Sutekh can be downloaded from Sourceforge at:

* http://sourceforge.net/projects/sutekh/files/sutekh/

Ubuntu packages may be obtained from Sutekh's Launchpad PPA:

* http://launchpad.net/~sutekh/+archive/ppa

Issues may be reported by emailing sutekh-users@lists.sourceforge.net.

If you're new to Sutekh or want to read about what Sutekh can do, you
might want to start with the online manual at:

* https://sourceforge.net/p/sutekh/wiki/SutekhManual_0.8/

Sutekh aims to be the swiss army knife of VTES card management
applications -- we hope you'll give the release a try.
