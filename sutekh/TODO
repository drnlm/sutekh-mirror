Backend:
 * DatabaseUpgrade could be less brittle
 * Better error and exception handling
 * Rework SutekhUtility to be less of a mess
 * Consider using SQLObject's new .throughTo method for populating / caching
   the objects abstract cards join to.
 * Use sqlobject 0.10's view support to work around mysql's poor subselect
   performance

Code Cleanup
 * Refactor gui classes somewhat - there's a fair bit code duplication ATM
   between the different View-Window-Controller sets for instance, and this
   looks like something worth addressing
   - Common base class for the TreeViews?
 * More tests
 * Rename references to PhysicalCardSet to CardSet, and rensure all references
   to AbstractCardSet are gone, except for AbstractCardSetParser
 * Add ways of specifying more limited test data sets
 * Add better persistence of data across tests, to avoid rerunning the 
   parser for each test and improve test runtime
 * Factor out things like the lists of expansions and disciplines in
   SutekhObjects to a seperate file

Gui (Functionality):
 * Finish ClusterCardList plugin.
 * Compare CardSet Plugin (basic version done. Could be improved)
 * Plugins for calling out to other VtES utilities as appropriate (http://ashheap.storageannex.com/utilities.htm)
 * Allow easy setting of the expansion when importing cards from file 
 * Convert the repeated functions in the plugins into functions in the plugin 
   API

Gui (Presentation):
 * Cleanup various dialogs, including
   * Unify some of the other dialogs and make various bits more reusable 
     (cf. CreateCardSetDialog hack in plugins)
 * Clean up the card set controller/model/view interactions
   - Move state changing code from CardSetMenu to CardSetController
 * Parse in a GTK rc file? (http://www.moeraki.com/pygtktutorial/pygtk2tutorial/ch-GtkRcFiles.html)
 * Icon support improvements
   - Allow icons in the tree view
 * Allow colouring options for the cards
 * Add more keyboard shortcuts

Website:
 * Create documentation.
 * Consider switching to Trac. 

Other Tasks:
 * Find some users and developers interested in Sutekh on Windows.

For 0.6:
 * Finish built-in tutorial and help.
 * Plugins
   - CSV export plugin for card sets
 * Import card sets from ARDB and FELDB
 * Improve intial setup - also download icons, offer to download images, etc.
 * Save the state for the open card sets (Cards shown, parent count mode, etc)
