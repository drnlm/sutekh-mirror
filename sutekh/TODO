Backend:
 * Add ordering mechanism for card lists.
 * Make filtering less slow (mainly for sqlite) 
      (seems OK with the indexes. Do we need more?).
 * DatabaseUpgrade could be less brittle
 * Better error and exception handling
 * Rework SutekhUtility to be less of a mess
 * Export directly to HTML.
 * Move other card set importers over to CardSetHolder and CardLookup.

Code Cleanup
 * Unify conventions ('Abstract' vs 'AbstractCardSet' in card set management, etc.)
 * Consolidate various dialogs - current reusablility is low
 * Refactor gui classes somewhat - there's a fair bit code duplication ATM
   between the different View-Window-Controller sets for instance, and this
   looks like something worth addressing

Gui (Functionality):
 * Improve Current Filter dialogs - better help, more examples, "Edit existing Filter", etc.
 * Add ordering selection dialog (possibly part of filtering dialog).
 * Turn AnalyzeDeck into something more useful - NM
 * Finish ClusterCardList plugin.
 * Compare CardSet Plugin (basic version done. Could be improved)
 * Improve About dialog.
 * Ability to specify the expansion a physical card comes from.
 * Replace HTML export plugin with direct export to HTML.
 * Plugins for calling out to other VtES utilities as appropriate (http://ashheap.storageannex.com/utilities.htm)
 * Improve Happy Families analysis (select number of disciplines to display,
   disciplines to use, etc)
 * Move other card set importers over to CardSetHolder and CardLookup.

Gui (Presentation):
 * Replace Multi-window GUI with one based on multiple panes
 * Parse in a GTK rc file? (http://www.moeraki.com/pygtktutorial/pygtk2tutorial/ch-GtkRcFiles.html)
 * Improve Create Card Set Management Window (multiple selection, right click menu, etc.)
 * Allow some way of marking card sets as active, and displaying used cards or 
   filtering on unused cards in the physical card list

Website:
 * Create logo for wiki.

Other Tasks:
 * Find some users and developers interested in Sutekh on Windows.
