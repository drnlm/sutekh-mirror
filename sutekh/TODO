Backend:
 * Add ordering mechanism for card lists.
 * DatabaseUpgrade could be less brittle
 * Better error and exception handling
 * Rework SutekhUtility to be less of a mess
 * Export directly to HTML.

Code Cleanup
 * Unify conventions ('Abstract' vs 'AbstractCardSet' in card set management, etc.)
 * Refactor gui classes somewhat - there's a fair bit code duplication ATM
   between the different View-Window-Controller sets for instance, and this
   looks like something worth addressing
 * Change function names to foo_bar convention.
 * Add encoding lines to all .py files.

Gui (Functionality):
 * Improve Current Filter dialogs:
    - Provide better help 
 * Add ordering selection dialog (possibly part of filtering dialog).
 * Turn AnalyzeDeck into something more useful - NM
   * Improve Happy Families analysis (select number of disciplines to display,
     disciplines to use, etc)
 * Finish ClusterCardList plugin.
 * Compare CardSet Plugin (basic version done. Could be improved)
 * Improve About dialog.
 * Replace HTML export plugin with direct export to HTML.
 * Plugins for calling out to other VtES utilities as appropriate (http://ashheap.storageannex.com/utilities.htm)
 * Add decent keyboard shortcuts

Gui (Presentation):
 * Cleanup various dialogs, including
   * Replace some dialogs with gtk.MessageDialogs
   * Unify some of the other dialogs and make various bits more reusable 
     (cf. CreateCardSetDialog hack in plugins)
 * Clean up the currently overly tangled controller/view/model interactions
 * Parse in a GTK rc file? (http://www.moeraki.com/pygtktutorial/pygtk2tutorial/ch-GtkRcFiles.html)
   * call set_name where appropriate, so Sutekh can be influenced by gtkrc file
 * Complete inuse flag work 
   * Add support to gui for setting + displaying status
   * Add filter on inuse card sets
   * Add support to CardSetHolder (for reloading cardlist's and restoring from file)
   * Save inuse status to XML file
 * Parse icons out of http://www.white-wolf.com/vtes/index.php?line=icons and use them in the GUI.

Website:
 * Create logo for wiki.

Other Tasks:
 * Find some users and developers interested in Sutekh on Windows.
