Backend:
 * DatabaseUpgrade could be less brittle
 * Better error and exception handling
 * Rework SutekhUtility to be less of a mess
 * Consider using SQLObject's new .throughTo method for populating / caching
   the objects abstract cards join to.

Code Cleanup
 * Unify conventions ('Abstract' vs 'AbstractCardSet' in card set management, etc.)
 * Refactor gui classes somewhat - there's a fair bit code duplication ATM
   between the different View-Window-Controller sets for instance, and this
   looks like something worth addressing
 * More tests

Gui (Functionality):
 * Finish ClusterCardList plugin.
 * Compare CardSet Plugin (basic version done. Could be improved)
 * Plugins for calling out to other VtES utilities as appropriate (http://ashheap.storageannex.com/utilities.htm)
 * Allow easy setting of the expansion for all selected cards and when importing
   cards from file 
 * Convert the repeated functions in the plugins into functions in the plugin 
   API

Gui (Presentation):
 * Cleanup various dialogs, including
   * Replace some dialogs with gtk.MessageDialogs
   * Unify some of the other dialogs and make various bits more reusable 
     (cf. CreateCardSetDialog hack in plugins)
 * Clean up the currently overly tangled controller/view/model interactions
 * Parse in a GTK rc file? (http://www.moeraki.com/pygtktutorial/pygtk2tutorial/ch-GtkRcFiles.html)
 * Icon support improvements
   - Allow icons in the tree view
 * Allow colouring options for the cards

Website:
 * Create documentation.
 * Consider switching to Trac. 

Other Tasks:
 * Find some users and developers interested in Sutekh on Windows.

For 0.6:
 * Factor out things like the lists of expansions and disciplines in SutekhObjects
   to a seperate file
 * Redo database design:
   - Allow Physical Card Sets to be subsets of other physical card sets
   - Convert current card collection list into a physical card set
   - drop abstract card sets - these become PCS's that are not subsets of the
     card collection PCS
 * Add decent keyboard shortcuts
 * Create built-in tutorial and help.
 * Look into Windows TreeView text search bug.
 * Plugins
   - Rework card set independance plugin
   - CSV export plugin for card sets
 * Address issues with exporting Sutekh card sets to ARDB and FELDB
