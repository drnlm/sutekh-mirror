Backend:
 * Add ordering mechanism for card lists.
 * Make filtering less slow (mainly for sqlite) 
      (seems OK with the indexes. Do we need more?).
 * Handle 'Creed' and 'Life' attributes of Imbued in WhiteWolfParser (done in branch)
 * DatabaseUpgrade functionality needs to be reworked to have unified way of passing 
   errors & warnings to the user interface (either Cli or Gui) (kinda done on branch)
 * Better error and exception handling
 * Rework SutekhUtility to be less of a mess

Database
 * Add title & sect columns to Abstract Card (done in branch)
 * Add Annotations field to the CardSets (done in branch)

Gui (Functionality):
 * Improve Filter selection dialog.  (And/Or)
 * Add ordering selection dialog (possibly part of filtering dialog).
 * Turn AnalyzeDeck into something more useful - NM
 * Finish ClusterCardList plugin.
 * Compare CardSet Plugin (basic version done. Could be improved)
 * Ability to specify the expansion a physical card comes from.
 * Consolidate various dialogs - current reusablility is low
 * Refactor gui classes somewhat - there's a fair bit code duplication ATM
   between the different View-Window-Controller sets for instance, and this
   looks like something worth addressing
 * Improve About dialog.

Gui (Presentation):
 * Give gui resource handling capablities to save window pos, etc - NM
 * Tabbed interface for Card Sets? - Need both tabs & windows?
 * Parse in a GTK rc file? (http://www.moeraki.com/pygtktutorial/pygtk2tutorial/ch-GtkRcFiles.html)

Website:
 * Create logo for wiki.

Release Candidate tasks:
 - Check everything works on Windows again (check with Philip before release)
 - Create setup.py file with bdist_egg (needs testing)
 * Improve "with text mode" option for HTML export (xsl file needs work)
 * Create Card Set Management Window (Abstract/Physical)
 * Merge Neil's database upgrade branch.
 * Add a Filter on Expansion + Rarity Pairs.
 * Additional Filter (Votes, Sect, etc).
