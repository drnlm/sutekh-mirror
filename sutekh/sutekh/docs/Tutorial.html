      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>Sutekh is a card management program for Vampire: The Eternal
      Struggle, a Collectable Card Game published by White Wolf.</p>
      <h3>Important Concepts</h3>
      <h4>The Card Collection</h4>
      <p>Sutekh distinguishes between two types of cards: Abstract Cards, and
      Physical Cards.</p>
      <p><em>Abstract Cards</em> represent a particular card in the published
      card list, for instance "Aire of Elation" or the Salubri vampire
      "Saulot". <em>Physical Cards</em> are copies of the cards in your
      collection, which might be a copy of "Aire of Elation" from the
      Camarilla Edition expansion. Abstract Cards are intended to
      describe the non-physical aspects of the card, such as discipline
      requirements and card text, while physical cards capture details such
      as expansion, and the number in your collection.</p>
      <p>Much of Sutekh is involved with working with your collection of
      cards, which will all be physical cards. The list of all possible cards
      is also available as the White wolf card list.</p>
      <h4>Card Sets</h4>
      <p>In addition to the lists of cards, Sutekh allows you to create
      sets of either Abstract or Physical Cards. A set of Physical Cards
      must be a subset of your card collection. These sets can be used to
      represent any subdivision of interest. Creating decks is the most 
      common use of card sets, but they can also be used to represent
      sets of cards you are interested in trading, different ways of 
      subdividing your collection (in storage, available for use, etc.)</p>
      <p>Abstract Card Sets are useful when the physical properties
      aren't important - speculative deck ideas, cards that one wishes to
      acquire, and so forth. Physical Card Sets are subsets of the collection
      and thus can be used to represent constructed decks, a cards available
      for trade, and so forth.</p>
