<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are new to Sutekh, try reading <a href="Tutorial.html">The Sutekh Tutorial</a>.</p>

<h2 id="concepts">Important Concepts</h2>

<p>Sutekh is concerned with two different types of objects: <em>Cards</em> and 
<em>Card Sets</em>.</p>

<p><em>Cards</em> are the individual cards as described by the official white wolf 
card list. Each card describes all the relevant properties of the card, 
such as the clan and discipline requirements, the cost, and the latest 
text for the card.</p>

<p><em>Card Sets</em> are collections of cards and describe the card and the number of 
copies of that card in the collection. An important concept is that card sets 
can be related in a parent-child hierarchy. A typical setup is to have a single 
card set for the main card collection (usually the <strong>My Collection</strong> card set), 
and other card sets, which represent the constructed decks, as children of this 
card set, but many other arrangements are possible.</p>

<h2 id="main">Main Window</h2>

<p>The main sutekh window can be split into a number of different panes.</p>

<p>The following panes are supported:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#ww">The White Wolf card list</a></li>
<li><a href="#card_set_list">The Card Set List</a></li>
<li><a href="#card_text">Card Text</a></li>
<li><a href="#card_image">Card Image</a></li>
<li><a href="#cardsets">Card Set</a> panes</li>
</ul>

<p>Each pane may have an associated menu for actions specific to that pane. 
The main window has a menu for global actions.</p>

<p>Panes can be easily rearranged. Dragging a pane onto another pane will swap  
the two panes.</p>

<h3 id="main_file">File</h3>

<p>The file menu has the following options.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Import Card Set</em>: Import a card set from a existing file. The following 
file types are supported:
<ul>
<li><em>Load Card Set from File</em>: Loads a card set saved in Sutekh&#8217;s <span class="caps"><span class="caps">XML</span></span> file 
format.</li>
<li><em>Import <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CSV</span></span> File</em>: Imports a card set from a comma-separated value file, 
as produced by a spreadsheet. This allows the columns for card set, number 
and expansion to be selected. </li>
<li><em>Import <span class="caps"><span class="caps">ARDB</span></span> or <span class="caps"><span class="caps">ELDB</span></span> Card Set</em>: Imports a file saved by either <span class="caps"><span class="caps">ARDB</span></span> and 
<span class="caps"><span class="caps">FELDB</span></span>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Import new White Wolf Card List and rulings</em>: Update the database with 
a new cardlist and/or rulings file. The files can either be local, or 
they can be downloaded from the White Wolf website directly.</li>
<li><em>Download <span class="caps">VTES</span> icons</em>: Attempt to download the icons from the White Wolf 
website.</li>
<li><em>Preferences</em>: Manages various preferences.
<ul>
<li><em>Save Current Pane Set</em>: Saves the current configuration of the panes. </li>
<li><em>Save Pane Set on Exit</em>: Saves the pane configuration when Sutekh exits.</li>
<li><em>Save Exact Pane Positions</em>: Saves the exact pane positions on exit.</li>
<li><em>Save Window Size</em>: Save the window size on exit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Restore saved configuration</em>: Restores the panes to the saved configuration.</li>
<li><em>Quit</em>: Exit Sutekh</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="main_pane_actions">Pane Actions</h3>

<p>This menu allows you to manage the panes in Sutekh.  The <em>Pane Actions</em> menu has 
the following options:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Equalize pane sizes</em>: This rearranges the panes so that each pane has the 
same width, and panes which are split vertically all have the same height.</li>
<li><em>Split current pane horizontally</em>: This splits the currently active pane 
into the currently active pane and a new pane to the immediate right of the 
active pane. The two panes of the same height, and half the width of the 
pane being split.</li>
<li><em>Split current pane vertically</em>: This splits the currently active pane 
into the currently active pane and a new pane below the active pane. The two 
panes of the same width, and half the height of the pane being split. It is not 
possible to split panes vertically multiple times.</li>
<li><em>Add New Pane</em>: This adds a new pane of the chosen type to the far right of 
the main window. </li>
<li><em>Replace Pane</em>: This opens a submenu, where the currently active pane 
can be replaced with any of the available options.</li>
<li><em>Close Pane</em>: This closes the currently active pane</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="main_plugins">Plugins</h3>

<p>The following plugins are available from the main menu:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#backup_plugin">Backup</a></li>
<li><a href="#images_plugin">Card Images</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="keyboard">Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>

<p>The following shortcuts are useful for most panes:</p>

<p>One can cycle between different panes using the <strong>&lt;Tab&gt;</strong> key.</p>

<p>The currently active pane can be closed using the <strong>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-W</strong> shortcut.</p>

<p>For panes which support filtering, the filter editing dialog can be activated 
using <strong>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-S</strong> (for specify filter), and the current filter can be 
toggled on and off by using <strong>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-T</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-+</strong> and <strong>&lt;Ctrl&gt;&#8212;</strong> shortcuts allow the entire tree displayed in a 
pane to either be fully expanded or completely collapsed.</p>

<h2 id="ww">White Wolf Card List</h2>

<p>This pane contains a list of all the cards imported from the official 
white wolf card list.</p>

<p>This will also list other relevant information about the card, such as the card 
cost, the card type, the disciplines or virtues associated with the card, the 
clans and creeds associated with the card, vampire titles, sects and groups, 
capacity and the expansions in which the card was printed.</p>

<h2 id="card_image">Card Image</h2>

<p>If the <a href="#images_plugin">Card Image Plugin</a> has been configured, this pane 
will display the appropriate card image for each pane. By default, the 
image is resized to fit the pane. By right clicking on the image, this can be changed. 
The following options are available:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Fit images to the pane</em>: This is the default</li>
<li><em>Show images at fixed size</em>: All the images are shown as 225&#215;300 in size.</li>

of the scan.</li>
</ul>

<p>If there are multiple images for the given card form the different expansions, 
Sutekh will attempt to display the correct expansion for the selected card. 
It&#8217;s possible to cycle through the available expansions by either left clicking 
on the image, or using the <em>Show next expansion image</em> and _Show previous 
expansion image_ options when right clicking on the frame.</p>

<li><a href="#stats_plugin">Clan Discipline Stats</a></li>
<li><a href="#grouping_plugin">Change Grouping</a></li>
<li><a href="#columns_plugin">Select Extra Columns</a></li>
<li><a href="#set_exp_plugin">Set selected cards to a single expansion</a></li>
<li><a href="#compare_plugin">Compare card set with another Card Set</a></li>
<li><a href="#analyze_plugin">Analyze Deck</a></li>
<li><a href="#indep_plugin">Test Card Set Independence</a></li>
<li><a href="#opening_hand_plugin">Simulate Opening Hand</a></li>
<li><a href="#prob_plugin">Card draw probabilities</a> 
 </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cardsets_keyboard">Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>

<p>For card sets, the following additional keyboard shortcuts exist.</p>

<p>The editable state of the card set can be toggled using <strong>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-E</strong>.</p>

<p>The current selection can be copied to the clipboard using <strong>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-C</strong></p>

<p>If the card set is editable, the current selection can be deleted using <strong>&lt;Del&gt;</strong> 
or pasted into the card set using <strong>&lt;Ctrl&gt;-V</strong></p>

<p>For an editable card set, the card number for the entire selection can be set 
in the range 1 to 9 directly by entering the number directly, or all the number 
for all cards in the selection can either be incremented or decremented by 
1 using either <strong>+</strong> or <strong>-</strong> respectively. If the card set is not editable, these 
keys have no effect.</p>

<h2 id="filters">Filters</h2>

<p>Filtering is one of the central activities in Sutekh.</p>

<h3 id="card_filters">Card Filters</h3>

<h3 id="card_set_filters">Card Set Filters</h3>

<h2 id="plugins">Plugin List</h2>

<h3 id="backup_plugin">Backup</h3>

<p>This allows you to either save or restore a full backup of the current 
database. The backup will be saved as a zip file and is independent of the 
database back end Sutekh uses. Consequently, the backup can also be used to 
transfer the complete state between different databases.</p>

<p>There are two options offered by the plugin:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Save a Full Backup</em></li>
<li><em>Restore a Full Backup</em></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Save a Full Backup</em> will save the current state (card sets and their contents) 
to the specified zip file. <em>Restore a Full Backup</em> will import all the card sets 
from the backup. Note that restoring a backup will replace anything currently 
in the database with the contents of the backup.</p>

<p>Backups can be saved at any time. Various actions, such as updating the WW 
card list, will also allow a backup to be saved.</p>

<h3 id="images_plugin">Card Images</h3>

<p>This plugin allows configuring the card images pane.</p>

<p>The image can be configured in three ways.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Download and install cardimages from feldb.extra.hu</em>: This attempts to 
download the images form the <span class="caps">FELDB</span> website, and makes them available to 
Sutekh. The zip file is quite large, so this option may take some time.</li>
<li><em>Install images from a local zip file</em>: If a zip file containing the 
images is available, Sutekh can install directly from this zipfile.</li>
<li><em>Choose a directory containing the images</em>: If the images have already been 
installed for some other reason (such as an existing <span class="caps">ARDB</span> or <span class="caps">FELDB</span> 
installation), then this option can be used to configure Sutekh to reuse that 
installation.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cluster_plugin">Cluster Cards</h3>

<h3 id="stats_plugin">Clan Discipline Stats</h3>

<h3 id="grouping_plugin">Change Grouping</h3>

<p>By default, Sutekh groups the cards into the separate card types. The grouping 
used can be changed via this menu option.</p>

<p>The following groupings are available:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Clans and Creeds</em>: Group cards by the either clan or the creed associated 
with the card. This treats the Imbued Creeds as if they were Vampire Clans.</li>
<li><em>Disciplines and Virtues</em>: Group cards by the either the disciplines or the 
virtues on the card. This treats the Imbued Virtues as if they were Vampire 
Disciplines.</li>
<li><em>Crypt or Library</em>: Split the card list into crypt and library cards</li>
<li><em>Card Type</em>: Group by card type. This is the default grouping. This grouping 
treats multi-type cards, such as <em>&#8220;Action Modifier/Combat&#8221;</em> cards as belonging 
to both the <em>&#8220;Action Modifier&#8221;</em> and the <em>&#8220;Combat&#8221;</em> groups.</li>
<li><em>Expansion</em>: Group by the expansions the cards have been printed in</li>
<li><em>Rarity</em>: Group the cards by the published rarity.</li>
<li><em>Sect</em>: Group cards by the Sect associated with the card.</li>
<li><em>Title</em>: Group cards by the political title on the card.</li>
<li><em>Cost</em>: Group cards by the cost on the card.</li>
<li><em>Multi Card Type</em>: Like the <em>Card Type</em> grouping, except this treats 
multi-type cards as separate types. Thus <em>&#8220;Action Modifier/Combat&#8221;</em> will 
appear as a separate group, and the cards will not be listed in either the 
<em>&#8220;Action Modifier&#8221;</em> or <em>&#8220;Combat&#8221;</em> groups.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="columns_plugin">Select Extra Columns</h3>

<p>By default, sutekh only shows the card name for the White Wolf Card List, 
and the number and card name for the card set lists. Additional columns 
to display can be selected using this plugin. The extra columns are:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Clans and Creeds:</em> Also display the clans or creeds associated with the 
card.</li>
<li><em>Group:</em> Show the group number for the card.</li>
<li><em>Disciplines and Virtues:</em> Show the Disciplines and Virtues associated with 
the card.</li>
<li><em>Card Type:</em> Also show the card type.</li>
<li><em>Expansions:</em> Show the expansions this card has been printed in.</li>
<li><em>Capacity or Life(Imbued):</em> Show the capacity associated with this card, or 
the life for the Imbued crypt cards. Ally &amp; retainer life is not shown.</li>
<li><em>Sect</em>: Show the Sect associated with the card.</li>
<li><em>Title</em>: Show the political title possessed by the vampire card.</li>
<li><em>Card Text</em>: Show the text printed on the card.</li>
<li>_Cost: Show the cost of the card.</li>
</ul>

<p>The display can be sorted by according to these columns, by clicking on the  
column header. When cards have equal values, they are sorted by the card name. 
Because the different cost types aren&#8217;t comparable, the 
cost column groups each distinct cost type together and sorts within the 
cost types.</p>

<p>If the icons have been downloaded from the white wolf site, then for the 
appropriate columns, the display can be toggled between the 
<em>Show Icons and Names</em>, <em>Show Text only</em>, <em>Show Icons only</em> using the radio 
buttons. This option will affect all the selected columns that can use icons.</p>

<h3 id="set_exp_plugin">Set selected cards to a single expansion</h3>

<p>This searches for the common expansions between all the selected cards, and 
allows the user to choose one of these. The physical expansion for all 
the selected cards is set to this common choice.</p>

<h3 id="compare_plugin">Compare card set with another Card Set</h3>

<h3 id="analyze_plugin">Analyze Deck</h3>

<h3 id="indep_plugin">Test Card Set Independence</h3>

<h3 id="opening_hand_plugin">Simulate Opening Hand</h3>

<p>This plugin treats the card set as a completed deck, and displays the 
expected distribution of cards in the opening hand and crypt. It is intended 
to give some idea of how the deck will work in practice. In addition, 
the plugin can generate example opening hands and crypts via the _Draw sample 
hand_ button.</p>

<h3 id="prob_plugin">Card draw probabilities</h3>

<p>This plugin displays the probability of drawing the selected cards from either 
the library or the crypt. Unlike the <em>simulate opening hand</em> plugin, this 
plugin displays results for longer sequences of drawing cards.</p>

<p>The plugin has the following settings which can be used to change the results.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>columns in table</em>: This sets the number of draws the columns with 
probabilities shown in the table and can range from 1 to 8. The first column 
is always the probably for the opening hand or crypt draw. Subsequent columns 
are the total probability after also drawing the number of extra cards shown in 
the column header.</li>
<li><em>step between columns</em>: This sets the number of cards drawn between columns 
and ranges from 1 to 10 (defaulting to 1). Each subsequent column after the 
first of the table shows the probabilities after drawing this number of 
additional cards.</li>
<li><em>cards of interest</em>: This sets the number of rows in the table, and can 
range from 1 to the total number of cards selected.</li>
</ul>

<p>The selected changes are only applied when the <em>recalculate table</em> button is 
pressed.</p>
