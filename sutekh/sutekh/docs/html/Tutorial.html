<h2 id="intro">The Intial Layout</h2>

<p>When you run Sutekh for the first time, it will display the following 4 panes.</p>

<ul>
<li>White Wolf Card List</li>
<li>Card Text</li>
<li>Card Set List</li>
<li>My Collection</li>
</ul>

<p>On subsuquent runs, the list of panes to show will be read from file. You 
can determine which panes are shown either by explicitly saving the layout 
using <strong>Save current pane set</strong> from the <strong>File->Preferences</strong>, or by letting the  
<strong>Save Pane Set on Exit</strong> option save the configuration.</p>

<h3>The White wolf card list</h3>

<p>Sutekh maintains a list of all the cards published by White Wolf as the 
<em>White Wolf Card List</em>. This lists all the cards, and, for each card, the 
expansions it has appeared in.</p>

<h3>Card Text</h3>

<p>The pane displays the information about the currently selected card.</p>

<h3>Card Sets</h3>

<p>Sutekh deals with collections of cards as card sets. Card Sets can either be 
stand-alone, or subsets of other card sets. This pane lists all the card sets 
which have been created. Initially, only a card set called <em>My Collection</em> 
is created, to hold the details of your card collection.</p>

<h3>My Collection</h3>

<p>This card set will hold the details of your card collection.</p>

<h2 id="cards">Working with Cards</h2>

<h3>Adding cards to a card set</h3>

<p>Card Sets are, by default, not editable, unless they are empty. This can be 
changed by toggling the <strong>Card Set is Editable</strong> menu entry iin the <strong>Edit</strong> Menu 
of the pane. Empty card sets are always editable. Before adding cards to a card 
set, ensure it is editable.</p>

<p>Cards can be added by dragging them from the <em>White Wolf Card List</em> to the pane 
for the card set. Selecting multiple cards will add a single copy of each 
selected cards. You can also use the copy &amp; paste options from the edit menu.</p>

<p>When a card set is editable, <strong>+</strong> and <strong>-</strong> buttons will be shown next to the card 
names. These can be used to increase or decrease the number for a given card.</p>

<p>You can also copy or drag-n-drop cards from other card sets. Unlike copying  
from the <em>White Wolf Card List</em>, copying from another card sets will copy all  
the selected cards.</p>

<h3>Removing cards</h3>

<p>Cards can be removed from a card set either by using the <strong>-</strong> button shown in 
the card set pane next to the card name, or by selecting cards and using the 
<strong>Delete selection</strong> option from the <strong>Edit</strong> menu.</p>

<h2 id="panes">Manipulating Panes</h2>

<p>The Sutekh user interface consists of panes. The number of panes and the layout 
is entirely up to you.</p>

<p>Panes can be added using the <strong>Add Pane</strong> Menu, while the contents of the 
currently selected pane can be replaced using the <strong>Replace Pane</strong> Menu. New 
blank panes can also be added by splitting the current pane, either into 
two panes next to each other, or into two panes stacked one above the other. 
Panes can be swapped by dragging a pane to it&#8217;s new location.</p>

<p>Card sets will be opened in a new pane added on the right by double clicking 
on the entry in the <em>Card Set</em> list. Card sets can also be opened in a specific 
pane by dragging the card set name from the <em>Card Set</em> list to the desired 
pane.</p>

<p>If the <strong>Save Pane Set on Exit</strong> option in the <strong>File->Preferences</strong> menu is 
set, Sutekh will save the current layout when you exit, and restore it on 
startup. You can also save the current layout using the <strong>Save Current Pane Set</strong> 
option.</p>

<h2 id="sets">Managing Card Sets</h2>

<h3>Creating a new card set</h3>

<p>A new card set can be created from the <em>Card Set List</em>, using *Create New 
Card Set* option from the <strong>Actions</strong> menu. The name is required, and must be 
unique. A Card set can either have <em>No Parent</em>, in which case it is a stand 
alone card set, or you can choose any existing card set as the parent, in 
which case it is a subset of that card set.</p>

<h3>Renaming a card set.</h3>

<p>A card set can be renamed using the <strong>Edit Card Set Properties</strong> option 
from the card set list&#8217;s <strong>Actions</strong> Menu. An open card set can also be renamed 
via the <strong>Edit Card Set Properties</strong> from the <strong>Actions</strong> Menu of the card set.</p>

<h3>Changing the parent of a card set.</h3>

<p>The parent of a card set can by changed via the <strong>Edit Card Set Properties</strong> 
option from the <strong>Actions</strong> Menu, or by dragging the selected card set onto it&#8217;s 
new parent in the card set list pane.</p>

<h3>Deleting a card set</h3>

<p>Card sets can by deleted via the <strong>Delete card set</strong> from the <strong>Actions</strong> menu of 
the card set list pane. Open card sets can also be deleted via the *Delete card 
set* option from the <strong>Actions</strong> menu of the card set pane.</p>

<h3><em>&#8220;In Use&#8221;</em> Card sets</h3>

<p>Card sets can be marked or unmarked as <em>&#8220;in use&#8221;</em>. The set of in use card sets 
are considered to be those currently active. The display modes dealing with 
child card sets only consider child cards sets that are marked as <em>&#8220;in use&#8221;</em>.</p>

<h3>The Different card display and count modes</h3>

<p>Sutekh has several options which control which cards are displayed for a  
card set, and what information about the cards is displayed.</p>

<p>The cards to display are also affected by the <a href="#filtering">filters</a> that are 
applied.</p>

<h4>The <em>&#8220;Cards to Show&#8221;</em> options</h4>

<p>This option, controls which cards are displayed.</p>

<p>The default mode shows only those card that belong to the actual card set.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show All Cards&#8221; shows the entire list of cards. This mode is often useful 
when entering cards into a card set for the first time</p>

<p>&#8220;Show all cards in parent card set&#8221; shows the combination of the card in this 
card set and all the cards in the parent card set. It is useful for seeing 
which cards are available for adding to a deck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show all cards in child card sets&#8221; shows all cards that belong to the 
<em>&#8220;in use&#8221;</em> children of this card set in addition to the cards in this card 
set.</p>

<h4>The <em>&#8220;Display Mode&#8221;</em> options</h4>

<p>This controls what information is displayed below the card name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show Expansions&#8221;, the default, shows which cards have been marked as belonging 
to which expansions below the card name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show No Children&#8221; disables anything below the card name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show Child Card Sets&#8221; shows the allocation of cards to the <em>&#8220;in use&#8221;</em> children 
of the current card set.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show Expansions + Child Card Sets&#8221; shows the expansions as for 
&#8220;Show Expansions&#8221;, and shows the card set information for each expansion below 
as well.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show Child Card Sets and Expansions&#8221; is the reverse of 
&#8220;Show Expansions + Child Card Sets&#8221;, showing the child card sets and the 
expansion information below.</p>

<h4>The <em>&#8220;Parent Card Count&#8221;</em> options</h4>

<p>If the card set is the child of another card set, you can also display 
information about the parent card set.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show Parent Count&#8221;, the default, will just show the count of the same 
card in the parent card set.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t show parent card counts&#8221; disables the column with the parent count.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show difference between Parent Count and this card set&#8221; shows the difference 
between the parent count and the count for this card set.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show difference between Parent Count and card sets in use&#8221; shows the 
difference between the parent card set and total in all the <em>&#8220;in use&#8221;</em> card 
set. If this card set is <strong>not</strong> <em>&#8220;in use&#8221;</em>, then the number of cards in this 
set does not influence this number.</p>
