<h3 id="intro">The Intial Layout</h3>

<p>When you run Sutekh for the first time, it will display the following 4 panes.
* White Wolf Card List
* Card Text
* Card Set List
* My Collection</p>

<p>On subsuquent runs, the list of panes to show will be read from file. You
can determine which panes are shown either by explicitly saving the layout
using <strong>Save current pane set</strong> from the <strong>File->Preferences</strong>, or by letting the 
<strong>Save Pane Set on Exit</strong> option save the configuration.</p>

<h4>The White wolf card list</h4>

<p>Sutekh maintains a list of all the cards published by White Wolf as the
<em>White Wolf Card List</em>. This lists all the cards, and, for each card, the
expansions it has appeared in.</p>

<h4>Card Text</h4>

<p>The pane displays the information about the currently selected card.</p>

<h4>Card Sets</h4>

<p>Sutekh deals with collections of cards as card sets. Card Sets can either be
stand-alone, or subsets of other card sets. This pane lists all the card sets
which have been created. Initially, only a card set called <em>My Collection</em>
is created, to hold the details of your card collection.</p>

<h4>My Collection</h4>

<p>This card set will hold the details of your card collection.</p>

<h3 id="cards">Working with Cards</h3>

<h4>Adding cards to a card set</h4>

<p>Card Sets are, by default, not editable, unless they are empty. This can be
changed by toggling the <strong>Card Set is Editable</strong> menu entry iin the <strong>Edit</strong> Menu
of the pane. Empty card sets are always editable. Before adding cards to a card
set, ensure it is editable.</p>

<p>Cards can be added by dragging them from the <em>White Wolf Card List</em> to the pane
for the card set. Selecting multiple cards will add a single copy of each
selected cards. You can also use the copy + paste options from the edit menu.</p>

<p>When a card set is editable, <strong>+</strong> and <strong>-</strong> buttons will be shown next to the card
names. These can be used to increase or decrease the number for a given card.</p>

<p>You can also copy or drag-n-drop cards from other card sets. Unlike copying
from the <em>White Wolf Card List</em>, copying from another card sets will copy all
the selected cards.</p>

<h4>Removing cards</h4>

<p>Cards can be removed from a card set either by using the <strong>-</strong> button shown in
the card set pane next to the card name, or by selecting cards and using the
<strong>Delete selection</strong> option from the <strong>Edit</strong> menu.</p>
