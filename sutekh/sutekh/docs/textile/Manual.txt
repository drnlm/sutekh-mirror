h2(#intro). Introduction

If you are new to Sutekh, try reading "The Sutekh Tutorial":Tutorial.html.


h2(#concepts). Important Concepts

Sutekh is concerned with two different types of objects: _Cards_ and
_Card Sets_.

_Cards_ are the individual cards as described by the official white wolf
card list. Each card describes all the relevant properties of the card,
such as the clan and discipline requirements, the cost, and the latest
text for the card.

_Card Sets_ are collections of cards and describe the card and the number of
copies of that card in the collection. An important concept is that card sets
can be related in a parent-child hierarchy. A typical setup is to have a single
card set for the main card collection (usually the *My Collection* card set),
and other card sets, which represent the constructed decks, as children of this
card set, but many other arrangements are possible.


h2(#main). Main Window

The main sutekh window can be split into a number of different panes.

The following panes are supported:

* "The White Wolf card list":#ww
* "The Card Set List":#card_set_list
* "Card Text":#card_text
* "Card Image":#card_image
* "Card Set":#cardsets panes

Each pane may have an associated menu for actions specific to that pane.
The main window has a menu for global actions.

Panes can be easily rearranged. Dragging a pane onto another pane will swap 
the two panes.

h3(#main_file). File

h3(#main_pane_actions). Pane Actions

This menu allows you to manage the panes in Sutekh.  The _Pane Actions_ menu has
the following options:

* _Equalize pane sizes_: This rearranges the panes so that each pane has the
same width, and panes which are split vertically all have the same height.
* _Split current pane horizontally_: This splits the currently active pane
into the currently active pane and a new pane to the immediate right of the
active pane. The two panes of the same height, and half the width of the
pane being split.
* _Split current pane vertically_: This splits the currently active pane
into the currently active pane and a new pane below the active pane. The two
panes of the same width, and half the height of the pane being split. It is not
possible to split panes vertically multiple times.
* _Add New Pane_: This adds a new pane of the chosen type to the far right of
the main window. 
* _Replace Pane_: This opens a submenu, where the currently active pane
can be replaced with any of the available options.
* _Close Pane_: This closes the currently active pane
 


h3(#main_plugins). Plugins

The following plugins are available from the main menu:

h3(#keyboard). Keyboard Shortcuts

The following shortcuts are useful for most panes:

One can cycle between different panes using the *&lt;Tab&gt;* key.

The currently active pane can be closed using the *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-W* shortcut.

For panes which support filtering, the filter editing dialog can be activated
using *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-S* (for specify filter), and the current filter can be
toggled on and off by using *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-T*.

The *&lt;Ctrl&gt;-+* and *&lt;Ctrl&gt;--* shortcuts allow the entire tree displayed in a
pane to either be fully expanded or completely collapsed.

in the range 1 to 9 directly by entering the number directly, or all the number
for all cards in the selection can either be incremented or decremented by
1 using either *+* or *-* respectively. If the card set is not editable, these
keys have no effect.

h2(#plugins). Plugin List

h3(#backup_plugin). Backup

This allows you to either save or restore a full backup of the current
database. The backup will be saved as a zip file and is independent of the
database back end Sutekh uses. Consequently, the backup can also be used to
transfer the complete state between different databases.

There are two options offered by the plugin:

* _Save a Full Backup_
* _Restore a Full Backup_

_Save a Full Backup_ will save the current state (card sets and their contents)
to the specified zip file. _Restore a Full Backup_ will import all the card sets
from the backup. Note that restoring a backup will replace anything currently
in the database with the contents of the backup.

Backups can be saved at any time. Various actions, such as updating the WW
card list, will also allow a backup to be saved.

h3(#images_plugin). Card Images

This plugin allows configuring the card images pane. 

h3(#cluster_plugin). Cluster Cards

h3(#stats_plugin). Clan Discipline Stats

h3(#grouping_plugin). Change Grouping

By default, Sutekh groups the cards into the separate card types. The grouping
used can be changed via this menu option.

The following groupings are available:

* _Clans and Creeds_: Group cards by the either clan or the creed associated
with the card. This treats the Imbued Creeds as if they were Vampire Clans.
* _Disciplines and Virtues_: Group cards by the either the disciplines or the
virtues on the card. This treats the Imbued Virtues as if they were Vampire
Disciplines.
* _Crypt or Library_: Split the card list into crypt and library cards
* _Card Type_: Group by card type. This is the default grouping. This grouping
treats multi-type cards, such as _"Action Modifier/Combat"_ cards as belonging
to both the _"Action Modifier"_ and the _"Combat"_ groups.
* _Expansion_: Group by the expansions the cards have been printed in
* _Rarity_: Group the cards by the published rarity.
* _Sect_: Group cards by the Sect associated with the card.
* _Title_: Group cards by the political title on the card.
* _Multi Card Type_: Like the _Card Type_ grouping, except this treats
multi-type cards as separate types. Thus _"Action Modifier/Combat"_ will
appear as a separate group, and the cards will not be listed in either the
_"Action Modifier"_ or _"Combat"_ groups.

h3(#columns_plugin). Select Extra Columns

By default, sutekh only shows the card name for the White Wolf Card List,
and the number and card name for the card set lists. Additional columns
to display can be selected using this plugin. The extra columns are:

* _Clans and Creeds:_ Also display the clans or creeds associated with the
card.
* _Group:_ Show the group number for the card.
* _Disciplines and Virtues:_ Show the Disciplines and Virtues associated with
the card.
* _Card Type:_ Also show the card type.
* _Expansions:_ Show the expansions this card has been printed in.
* _Capacity or Life(Imbued):_ Show the capacity associated with this card, or
the life for the Imbued crypt cards. Ally & retainer life is not shown.
* _Sect_: Show the Sect associated with the card.
* _Title_: Show the political title possessed by the vampire card.
* _Card Text_: Show the text printed on the card.

The display can be sorted by according to these columns, by clicking on the 
column header. 

If the icons have been downloaded from the white wolf site, then for the
appropriate columns, the display can be toggled between the
_Show Icons and Names_, _Show Text only_, _Show Icons only_ using the radio
buttons. This option will affect all the selected columns that can use icons.

h3(#set_exp_plugin). Set selected cards to a single expansion

This searches for the common expansions between all the selected cards, and
allows the user to choose one of these. The physical expansion for all
the selected cards is set to this common choice. 

h3(#compare_plugin). Compare card set with another Card Set

h3(#analyze_plugin). Analyze Deck

h3(#indep_plugin). Test Card Set Independence

h3(#opening_hand_plugin). Simulate Opening Hand

This plugin treats the card set as a completed deck, and displays the
expected distribution of cards in the opening hand and crypt. It is intended
to give some idea of how the deck will work in practice. In addition,
the plugin can generate example opening hands and crypts via the _Draw sample
hand_ button. 

h3(#prob_plugin). Card draw probabilities

This plugin displays the probability of drawing the selected cards from either
the library or the crypt. Unlike the _simulate opening hand_ plugin, this
plugin displays results for longer sequences of drawing cards.

The plugin has the following settings which can be used to change the results.

* _columns in table_: This sets the number of draws the columns with
probabilities shown in the table and can range from 1 to 8. The first column
is always the probably for the opening hand or crypt draw. Subsequent columns
are the total probability after also drawing the number of extra cards shown in
the column header.
* _step between columns_: This sets the number of cards drawn between columns
and ranges from 1 to 10 (defaulting to 1). Each subsequent column after the
first of the table shows the probabilities after drawing this number of
additional cards.
* _cards of interest_: This sets the number of rows in the table, and can
range from 1 to the total number of cards selected.

The selected changes are only applied when the _recalculate table_ button is
pressed.
