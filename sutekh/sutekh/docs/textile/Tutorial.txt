h4. The White wolf card list

Sutekh maintains a list of all the cards published by White Wolf as the
*White Wolf Card List*. This list all the cards, and, for each card, the
expansions it has appeared in. 

h4. Card Sets

Sutekh deals with collections of cards as card sets. Card Sets can either be
stand-alone, or subsets of other card sets. The card set *My Collection*
is created by default to hold your card colletion. Typically, most card sets
will be subsets of *My Collection*.
