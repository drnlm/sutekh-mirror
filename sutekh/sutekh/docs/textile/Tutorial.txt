h2(#intro). The Intial Layout

When you run Sutekh for the first time, it will display the following 4 panes.

* White Wolf Card List
* Card Text
* Card Set List
* My Collection

On subsuquent runs, the list of panes to show will be read from file. You
can determine which panes are shown either by explicitly saving the layout
using *Save current pane set* from the *File->Preferences*, or by letting the 
*Save Pane Set on Exit* option save the configuration.

h3. The White wolf card list

Sutekh maintains a list of all the cards published by White Wolf as the
_White Wolf Card List_. This lists all the cards, and, for each card, the
expansions it has appeared in. 

h3. Card Text

The pane displays the information about the currently selected card.

h3. Card Sets

Sutekh deals with collections of cards as card sets. Card Sets can either be
stand-alone, or subsets of other card sets. This pane lists all the card sets
which have been created. Initially, only a card set called _My Collection_
is created, to hold the details of your card collection.

h3. My Collection

This card set will hold the details of your card collection.

h2(#cards). Working with Cards

h3. Adding cards to a card set

Card Sets are, by default, not editable, unless they are empty. This can be
changed by toggling the *Card Set is Editable* menu entry iin the *Edit* Menu
of the pane. Empty card sets are always editable. Before adding cards to a card
set, ensure it is editable.

Cards can be added by dragging them from the _White Wolf Card List_ to the pane
for the card set. Selecting multiple cards will add a single copy of each
selected cards. You can also use the copy & paste options from the edit menu.

When a card set is editable, *+* and *-* buttons will be shown next to the card
names. These can be used to increase or decrease the number for a given card.

You can also copy or drag-n-drop cards from other card sets. Unlike copying 
from the _White Wolf Card List_, copying from another card sets will copy all 
the selected cards.

h3. Removing cards

Cards can be removed from a card set either by using the *-* button shown in
the card set pane next to the card name, or by selecting cards and using the
*Delete selection* option from the *Edit* menu.

h2(#panes). Manipulating Panes

The Sutekh user interface consists of panes. The number of panes and the layout
is entirely up to you. 

Panes can be added using the *Add Pane* Menu, while the contents of the
currently selected pane can be replaced using the *Replace Pane* Menu. New
blank panes can also be added by splitting the current pane, either into
two panes next to each other, or into two panes stacked one above the other.
Panes can be swapped by dragging a pane to it's new location. 

Card sets will be opened in a new pane added on the right by double clicking
on the entry in the _Card Set_ list. Card sets can also be opened in a specific
pane by dragging the card set name from the _Card Set_ list to the desired
pane.

If the *Save Pane Set on Exit* option in the *File->Preferences* menu is
set, Sutekh will save the current layout when you exit, and restore it on
startup. You can also save the current layout using the *Save Current Pane Set*
option.

h2(#sets). Managing Card Sets

h3. Creating a new card set

A new card set can be created from the _Card Set List_, using *Create New
Card Set* option from the *Actions* menu. The name is required, and must be
unique. A Card set can either have _No Parent_, in which case it is a stand
alone card set, or you can choose any existing card set as the parent, in
which case it is a subset of that card set. 

h3. Renaming a card set.

A card set can be renamed using the *Edit Card Set Properties* option
from the card set list's *Actions* Menu. An open card set can also be renamed
via the *Edit Card Set Properties* from the *Actions* Menu of the card set.

h3. Changing the parent of a card set.

The parent of a card set can by changed via the *Edit Card Set Properties*
option from the *Actions* Menu, or by dragging the selected card set onto it's
new parent in the card set list pane.

h3. Deleting a card set

Card sets can by deleted via the *Delete card set* from the *Actions* menu of
the card set list pane. Open card sets can also be deleted via the *Delete card
set* option from the *Actions* menu of the card set pane.

h3. _"In Use"_ Card sets

Card sets can be marked or unmarked as _"in use"_. The set of in use card sets
are considered to be those currently active. The display modes dealing with
child card sets only consider child cards sets that are marked as _"in use"_.
