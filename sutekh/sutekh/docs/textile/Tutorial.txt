h3(#intro). The Intial Layout

When you run Sutekh for the first time, it will display the following 4 panes.

* White Wolf Card List
* Card Text
* Card Set List
* My Collection

On subsuquent runs, the list of panes to show will be read from file. You
can determine which panes are shown either by explicitly saving the layout
using *Save current pane set* from the *File->Preferences*, or by letting the 
*Save Pane Set on Exit* option save the configuration.

h4. The White wolf card list

Sutekh maintains a list of all the cards published by White Wolf as the
_White Wolf Card List_. This lists all the cards, and, for each card, the
expansions it has appeared in. 

h4. Card Text

The pane displays the information about the currently selected card.

h4. Card Sets

Sutekh deals with collections of cards as card sets. Card Sets can either be
stand-alone, or subsets of other card sets. This pane lists all the card sets
which have been created. Initially, only a card set called _My Collection_
is created, to hold the details of your card collection.

h4. My Collection

This card set will hold the details of your card collection.

h4. Adding cards to a card set

Card Sets are, by default, not editable, unless they are empty. This can be
changed by toggling the *Card Set is Editable* menu entry iin the *Edit* Menu
of the pane. Empty card sets are always editable. Before adding cards to a card
set, ensure it is editable.

Cards can be added by dragging them from the _White Wolf Card List_ to the pane
for the card set. Selecting multiple cards will add a single copy of each
selected cards. You can also use the copy + paste options from the edit menu.

When a card set is editable, *+* and *-* buttons will be shown next to the card
names. These can be used to increase or decrease the number for a given card.

You can also copy or drag-n-drop cards from other card sets. Unlike copying 
from the _White Wolf Card List_, copying from another card sets will copy all 
the selected cards.

h4. Removing cards

Cards can be removed from a card set either by using the *-* button shown in
the card set pane next to the card name, or by selecting cards and using the
*Delete selection* option from the *Edit* menu.
