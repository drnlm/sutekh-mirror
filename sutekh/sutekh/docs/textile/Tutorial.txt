h2(#intro). The Initial Layout

When you run Sutekh for the first time, it will display the following four
panes:

* White Wolf Card List
* Card Text
* Card Set List
* My Collection

On subsequent runs, Sutekh will read the list of panes to display from a file.
You can determine which panes are shown either by explicitly saving the layout
using *Save current pane set* in *File->Preferences*, or by letting the
*Save Pane Set on Exit* option save the configuration.

h3. The White Wolf card list

Sutekh maintains a list of all the cards published by White Wolf as the
_White Wolf Card List_. It lists the cards and the expansions in which each card
has appeared.

h3. Card Text

This pane displays information about the currently selected card.

h3. Card Sets

In Sutekh, collections of cards are card sets. Card Sets can either be
stand-alone or subsets of other card sets. This pane lists all the card sets
which have been created. Initially, only a card set called _My Collection_
is created, to store the details of your card collection.

h3. My Collection

This card set will store the details of your card collection.

h2(#cards). Working with Cards

h3. Adding cards to a card set

Card Sets are by default not editable, unless they are empty. You can change
this property by toggling the *Card Set is Editable* menu entry in the *Edit*
Menu of the pane. Empty card sets are always editable. Before adding cards to a
card set, ensure that it is editable.

You can add cards by dragging them from the _White Wolf Card List_ to the pane
of the card set. You can also use the copy and paste options from the edit menu.
If you copy multiple cards, you will add a single copy of each distinct selected
card to the destination set. If you have selected multiple copies of the same
card, only one copy will be added.

If a card set is editable, *+* and *-* buttons are displayed next to the card
names. You can use these to increase or decrease the number of copies of a card
that are present in the set.

You can also change this value using the keyboard. You can type '+' and '-' to
increment or decrement the count of a selected card, or type a number from one
to nine to set the value directly.

You can also copy and paste or drag and drop cards from other card sets. If you
do this, all copies of each selected card which are in the source set will be
added to the destination set.

h3. Removing cards

You can remove cards from a card set by using the *-* button shown in the card
set pane next to the card name, by using the keyboard shortcuts to change
the number of cards, or by selecting cards and using the *Delete selection*
option in the *Edit* menu.

h2(#panes). Manipulating Panes

The Sutekh user interface consists of panes. The number of panes and the layout
is entirely configurable.

You can add panes using the *Add Pane* Menu, and replace the contents of the
currently selected pane using the *Replace Pane* Menu. You can also add new
blank panes by splitting the current pane; either into two panes next to each
other, or into two panes stacked one above the other. You can swap two panes by
dragging one onto the other.

When you double-click on an entry in the _Card Set_ list, the card set will be
opened in a new pane added on the right. You can also open a card set in a
specific pane by dragging the card set name from the _Card Set_ list to the
desired pane.

If the *Save Pane Set on Exit* option in the *File->Preferences* menu is
set, Sutekh will save the current layout when you exit, and restore it on
startup. You can also save the current layout using the *Save Current Pane Set*
option.

You can remove panes from the list using the *Pane Actions->Remove current pane*
menu option (or the associated keyboard shortcut). If you delete a card set, its
pane will be closed automatically.

h2(#sets). Managing Card Sets

h3. Creating a new card set

You can create a new card set in the _Card Set List_ using the *Create New
Card Set* option in the *Actions* menu. The name is required, and must be
unique. You can specify that a card set has _No Parent_, in which case it will
be a stand-alone card set, or you can select any existing card set to be its
parent, in which case the new set will be a subset of that card set.

h3. Renaming a card set.

You can rename a card set using the *Edit Card Set Properties* option in the
*Actions* menu of the card set list pane. You can also rename an open card set
using the *Edit Card Set Properties* option in the *Actions* Menu of the card
set pane.

h3. Changing the parent of a card set.

You can change the parent of a card set by using the *Edit Card Set Properties*
option in the *Actions* Menu, or by dragging the selected card set onto its
new parent in the card set list pane.

h3. Deleting a card set

You can delete a card set using the *Delete card set* option in the *Actions*
menu of the card set list pane. You can also delete an open card set using the
*Delete card set* option in the *Actions* menu of the card set pane.

h3. _"In Use"_ Card sets

Card sets can be marked or unmarked as _"In Use"_. _"In Use"_ card sets
are considered to be those which are currently active. Display modes which
show child card sets only consider child cards sets which are marked as
_"In Use"_.

h3. The Different card display and count modes

Sutekh has several setings which control which cards are displayed in a card set
pane, and what information about the cards is displayed.

The display of cards will also be affected by any "filters":#filtering that are
applied.

h4. The _"Cards to Show"_ options

This setting controls which cards are displayed.

The default mode shows only those cards that belong to the actual card set.

"Show All Cards" shows the entire list of cards. This mode is often useful
when you are entering cards into a card set for the first time.

"Show all cards in parent card set" shows the combination of the cards in this
card set and all the cards in the parent card set. It is useful for seeing
which cards are available to be added to a deck.

"Show all cards in child card sets" shows all cards that belong to the
_"In Use"_ children of this card set in addition to the cards in this card
set.

h4. The _"Display Mode"_ options

This setting controls what information is displayed below the card name.

"Show Expansions" shows the expansions of the cards, and a card count for each
expansion. This is the default.

"Show No Children" disables the display of additional information below the
card name.

"Show Child Card Sets" shows the allocation of cards to the _"In Use"_ children
of the current card set.

"Show Expansions and Child Card Sets" shows the expansion information as well as
the child card set breakdown for each expansion.

"Show Child Card Sets and Expansions" is the reverse of
"Show Expansions and Child Card Sets". It shows the child card sets and the
expansion breakdown for each child card set.

h4. The _"Parent Card Count"_ options

If the card set is the child of another card set, you can also display
information about the parent card set.

"Show Parent Count" shows the count of the same card in the parent card set.
This is the default.

"Don't show parent card counts" disables the column with the parent count.

"Show difference between Parent Count and this card set" shows the difference
between the parent count and the count for this card set.

"Show difference between Parent Count and card sets in use" shows the
difference between the parent card set count and the total count in all
_"In Use"_ card sets. If this card set is *not* _"In Use"_, then the number of
cards in this set does not influence this number.

h2(#filtering). Filtering

Sutekh has a very powerful filtering model, which allows you to perform quite
complex queries on the card database.

h3. The Basic filters

There are several basic filters available, such as _Clan_, _Discipline_,
_"Card Text"_ etc..

Most of these filters allow only a limited range of options, which you can
select from a drop-down list. The _Clan_ filter, for example, only accepts the
clans listed in the database as input. You can select multiple clans, and the
filter will match a card if it matches any of the selected clans.

Other filters, such as the _"Card Text"_ filter, require you to enter a string.
The filter will match any card with card text that contains this string. The '%'
and '_' characters can be used as wildcards: '%' will match any number of
letters, and '_' will match exactly one.

The _"Card Sets In Use"_ filter takes no input.

The _"Card Count"_ filter requires you to input a list of card counts and a card
set.

h3. Combing basic filters

You can combine these basic filters to create more complex queries.

Multiple filters can be combined according to one of the following rules:

_"All of"_ requires all of the included filters to be satisfied simultaneously.
It is useful for finding cards which require a discipline and a given cost, for
example.

_"Any of"_ requires that at least one of the included filters is satisfied.

_"Not All of"_ requires that at least one of the included filters is not
satisfied. The difference between _"Not All of_" and _"Any of"_ is that
_"Any of"_ will include the results of any cards that match all of the filters,
while _"Not All of"_ will exclude those, but return cards that satisfy none of
the filters.

_"None of"_ requires that none of the included filters be satisfied.

In addition to the basic filters, the *Sub-filter* option allows these
combinations to be nested. Thus an _"All of"_ filter can include _"Any of"_ or
_"None of"_ filters below it, which allows for extremely complex queries to
be constructed.

For example, to find all cards that require either 'Follower of Set' or
'Serpentis', but not both, you could construct the following filter:

An _"Any of"_ filter, which includes two _"All of"_ sub-filters. Each
sub-filter includes the _Clan_ and _Discipline_ basic filters, and one is
set to match 'Followers of Set' and NOT 'Serpentis' while the other is set to
match NOT 'Followers of Set' and 'Serpentis'.

Once you have constructed a filter, you can name and save it, and load it again
later.

h3. Filtering the Card Set List

You can also filter the card set list. The basic filters available here are:

* The card set name
* The card set author
* The card set description
* The name of the parent card set
* Text in the annotations of the card set
* All card sets marked in use

TheYou can also combine these filters, and create queries such as
'All card sets in use where the card set name includes "Nosferatu"'.

When Sutekh displays card sets which match a filter, all the direct ancestors of
those sets are also displayed even if they do not match the filter themselves,
so that the matching sets can be shown in their correct position in the
hierarchy.

h2(#tips). Useful Tips

h3. Entering card sets

The different display modes are often useful for entering a card set quickly.
Start with with _"Show all cards"_ or _"Show cards in parent card set"_ and
then increment the cards which you wish to add to the current card set.
You can also use the _"Card Set from Filter"_ option to create a card set.

When you import card sets from other formats, the expansion information may be
missing, in which case these cards will be imported without an expansion. If you
know that all the imported cards are from the same expansion -- for example, if
the card set is a starter deck -- you can use the
_"Set selection to single expansion"_ option from the _Plugins_ menu to set all
the cards to the correct expansion quickly.
