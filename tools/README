This directory is for various useful tools.

The follwoing are currently included:

sutekh_pylint - A rc file for pylint which enforces Sutekh's naming convention.
          Use as pylint --rcfile sutekh_pylint

check_header.py - A simple script that checks if the comment headers match the
          required style. Checks for coding line, vim modeline, 
          copyright notice, reference to the license and wether the first
          line corresponds to the file name. Usage check_headers -f file
          Intended to be used via find's exec option (something like
          find <dir> -name "*py" -exec python check_header.py -f \{\} \;)

dict_keys_check.py - A plugin to pylint to warn about using 
          "for x in dict.keys()" syntax. Ensure the directory with this
          file is in the PYTHONPATH, and uncomment the load-plugins line
          in sutekh_pylint

whitespace_eol.py - A plugin for pylint which warns about whitespace at the
          end of the line. This plugin ignores syntax, so spaces in comments
          and strings are also caught.  Add to load_plugins in sutekh_pylint,
          as for dict_keys_check.py.
