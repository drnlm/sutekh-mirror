This directory is for various useful tools.

The following are currently included:

sutekh_pylint - A rc file for pylint which enforces Sutekh's naming convention.
          Use as pylint --rcfile sutekh_pylint

run_all_tests.sh - a simple bash script that can be used to run all the test
         cases for Sutekh.

check_header.py - A simple script that checks if the comment headers match the
          required style. Checks for coding line, vim modeline, 
          copyright notice, reference to the license and wether the first
          line corresponds to the file name. Usage check_headers -f file
          Intended to be used via find's exec option (something like
          find <dir> -name "*py" -exec python check_header.py -f \{\} \;)

check_single_line_docstring_format.sh - Shell script thet attempts to detect
          docstrings not using the """ format. While this is reasonably
          accurate, it can produce false positives. 

dict_keys_check.py - A plugin to pylint to warn about using 
          "for x in dict.keys()" syntax. Ensure the directory with this
          file is in the PYTHONPATH, and uncomment the load-plugins line
          in sutekh_pylint

pep8_wrapper.py - A plugin to pylint that runs the pep8 checking utility
          and adds a subset of pep8 complaints to the pylint output. Add
          to load_plugins in sutekh_pylint, as for dict_keys_check.py.
          Requires the pep8 utility.

whitespace_eol.py - A plugin for pylint which warns about whitespace at the
          end of the line. This plugin ignores syntax, so spaces in comments
          and strings are also caught.  Add to load_plugins in sutekh_pylint,
          as for dict_keys_check.py. 

pyprotocols_interface.py - A plugin so pylint will recognise the PyProtocols
          advise statemt as implementing an Interface. This aims to cover
          the usage in Sutekh, and thus isn't very general.

skip_sqlobject_constructors - A plugin that skips the parameter checks for
          SQLObject classes. This is fairly specific to Sutekh.
